Hello! I am an undergraduate Industrial Engineering student at the University of Toronto, specializing in AI/ML. My core interest lies in applying robust AI/ML, operations research, and optimization techniques to create intelligent and impactful solutions for real-world problems, especially those in energy systems, environmental sustainability, and geospatial applications.

Currently, I'm developing novel machine learning approaches for handling strict, complex constraints in power systems as a research student with Prof. Priya Donti (MIT <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/">EECS</a> & <a href="https://lids.mit.edu/">LIDS</a>). Alongside my research, I am also an AI intern at <a href="https://rocketinnovationstudio.ca/">Rocket Innovation Studio</a> (Architecture team), contributing to the development of AI-driven solutions for <a href="https://rocketmortgage.ca/">Rocket</a>'s business needs. At UofT, I have worked with Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/">Florian Shkurti</a> (<a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute</a>, <a href="https://robotics.utoronto.ca/">UofT Robotics Institute</a>) on perception algorithms implementation.

I'm driven by the challenge of designing intelligent systems that are not only effective but also safe and reliable, especially within critical domains.
